# Pokemon Data Scraper

Originally called the Pokemon Egg Generator, this repo hosted the code for a website that would generate eggs for use
with the BulkImport plugin for PKHeX. Since its inception, the generator has been moved to the BulkImport plugin -- now
called the <a href="https://github.com/CDNRae/pkhex-bulk-egg-generator">Bulk Egg Generator</a>. The code here is now
used to generate the data required by the Bulk Egg Generator.

All the data is obtained through PokeAPI, a wonderful project that can be found <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">here</a>.
